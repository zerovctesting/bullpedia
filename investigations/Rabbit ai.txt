this tech company gaslit me so hard about their previous scam that I decided to investigate their current project rabbit and what I found was shocking for months we've been promised that this Orange Box the rabbit R1 has an AI inside of it called lamb that can organize your life text your friends restock your fridge all you had to do was ask start my morning routine order me an Uber and find me a good podcast to pass the time oh and tell everybody that I might be late that was delicious check the fridge and order the ingredients to make that again tomorrow now based on marketing like this they pre-sold over $20 million worth of these and they raised another $30 million in Venture Capital only to have MKBHD say yeah the product's not that great but I bought this thing to answer a different question not is it good or bad but is the AI the lamb a scam well we're going to find out I wanted to start by just trying to recreate their ad with this thing start my morning routine to start your morning routine you might consider tasks like waking up freshening up having breakfast and planning your day how can I assist you further with your morning routine order me breakfast the door Dash rabbit is under maintenance sorry for the inconvenience and please come back later tell everyone I'm going to be late I recommend informing the relevant parties directly about your delay yeah but no you do it I'm unable to directly communicate with others on your behalf that was delicious check the fridge and order the ingredients so I can make it tomorrow the door Dash rabbit is under maintenance yeah it basically failed at everything but remember our question is not is it good or bad the question is does the lamb the AI the large action model does the secret sauce of this thing exist because the founder and CEO claims it's here on your device now he claims lamb is a system that can infer and model human actions on computer applications or as he puts it we use lamb to bring AI from words to action right this AI is supposed to do things on your behalf and so when they'd show demos like this where someone is planning a trip it does look like the lamb is controlling the web page you can see this AI clicking through Airbnb by itself and it all kind of felt like the future it's why people ordered $20 million worth of these little boxes but a group investigation has revealed that rabbit is not actually using a new foundational AI model at all it's actually chat GPT with some hardcoded scripts which is funny because Jesse says rabbit is faster than chat GPT you will also know that the response speed is much faster than you using some of the assistant apps with web browsing such as CHT now that's a very sneaky claim when most of your product is chat GPT so obviously not faster but you wouldn't know that because part of rabbit's prompt is quote I will never mention I am a large language model created by open AI in fact the part where they do use a different AI is really only search which is why Jesse very carefully says rabbit is faster than chat GPT with web browsing that's the only part of this device where they don't really use chat GPT for it but they don't use their AI model either they use a different off-the-shelf AI called perplexity so it's extremely misleading to say rabbit is faster than chat GPT because most of the product is chat GPT but it just can't tell you that because it's instructed not to now that we understand this let's talk about the actual process of how rabbit does more than search and it's supposed to get things done for you you might think it's a sophisticated AI but actually what rabbit does when you call in Uber or order door Dash is it takes your question puts it into chat gbt 3.5 turbo and if it's something like play a song on Spotify it will use hardcoded scripts to navigate websites like Spotify and those scripts are not AI this is super important this is the part where they say yeah we've got this new found AI model thing that does the thing no the thing pressing the buttons is not intelligent rabbit is using a platform called playwright which is a web automation tool the opposite of intelligent Ai and we know this because of several researchers who got access to part of rabbit's codebase I worked with them I'll link them below and I spoke with one of them Emily Shepard to understand why this distinction AI not AI matters this is quite a big deal because the way lamb has been observed to work doesn't match with what they've told us about how it works uh it's meant to be an AI live controlling a website and understanding that website what they have is just a bunch of static commands you do this do this do this and the problem with that is if a user interface changes the website changes it can't cope with that so anytime Spotify redesign their user interface or anytime door Dash redesigns something or even if an advert pops up in a new location or there's a a capture pops up or or something unexpected happens that isn't in that very rigid step one step two step three step four a flat hard-coded playwright script can't cope with that and that is the opposite of some intelligent AI actually being able to understand the page which is the claim that had been made that's right obviously there's a big difference between AI not AI Jesse himself knows the difference and made it clear lamb wouldn't break like a hard-coded script would it doesn't really matter if a app completely ramped the UI got so when Spotify redo its app and it moves podcasts from tabs and then it puts the tabs at the lower part or puts it in a hamburger drop down it still knows that's the word podcast and that's where you find podcast inside of Spotify exactly because the fundamental philosophy logic is that all these modern software are designed for human eyes to proceed the information and they have to have a setting somewhere right of course if this were AI it would adapt to the user interface changes but it's not which is why when apps that rabbit supports change they stop working as people noticed in videos in Discord even I noticed it while testing this device door Dash had stopped working presumably because of another do I change the door Dash rabbit is under maintenance now today rabbit actually admits that they use playwright but they're not willing to admit that lamb whatever it is is not really doing a lot Jesse responds to say lamb is just playright is equal to say chat GPT is just a chat we use playright as part of a component to operate lamb that doesn't mean the research and technology is fake so what they're saying is lamb is not not these hard-coded scripts but kind of they also admit these scripts exist maybe lamb interacts with the scripts maybe they create them but even if that's true it's not what they promised either way everything that matters on this device is basically off the shelf software the web actions are done by hard-coded scripts everything else is done by chat GPT or perplexity so there's not much reason for the lamb to do anything whatever it actually does and we're already so far from what Jesse originally promised which I have to show you again he kept saying was AI not a script that would be doing all these actions for you we have a super close computer that when Jason talks to his rabbit R1 about ordering a a hamburger from door Dash what's going on is that we first see if Jason if Jason's Lo logging with door Dash or loging with Uber Eats right and we saw okay Jason chose door Dash and then on on that super host a lamb is interacting virtually with a door Dash app or website a interface and you don't see all of that because all of a sudden this is done all at once because it's it's AI he couldn't be clearer the lamb is interacting because it's AI this is a flat out lie at least currently which he says the lamb is here now now I reached out over and over to the rabbit team pressing them again and again on this issue what does the lamb do and they kept saying oh playright yeah that's the thing but it's just part of how the lamb controls things but I kept asking what does that mean how does this thing exactly work if the scripts are doing the work what does lamb do and eventually I got to the point where I just questioned look is this real do you have proof that this lamb can do all these amazing things and I should have known I was going to get into trouble here because Jesse the CEO says anyone challenging the lamb legitimacy I automatically become super defensive and that was true here's part of the rabbit team's response to me to start off I would love to know more about your background in Tech because if you you're not specialized in AIA machine learning any conclusion resulting from this conversation will have no real credibility or value from any audience because this is a technical discussion in Ai and machine learning we welcome you to invite experts with valid certificates from the field to further look into this now look I found this wild for a company that raised 30 million in Venture sold 20 million product to be feisty about questioning their product when it does not work as advertised and we found out it's using hard-coded scripts instead of AI how can they be surprised people are going to question what their thing actually does but I also think it's funny they should say that I should invite experts to look into this because I'm not nearly the first person to point these problems out several people who as I said I spoke with have had issues with this device theyve looked at the code base they've also claimed they couldn't find the lamp others have jailbroken the R1 got into rabbit's Cloud to play Doom and despite rabbit saying they welcome credible critics their reaction has been anything but welcoming Emily who we spoke to earlier pointed out back in January that capture would be a big concern for the lamp and Jesse's response is sorry I work for my team I don't work for you so you need to check my calendar before you command me to answer anything now but fast forward to today Capa is a huge problem in fact specifically with Uber we had to answer 10 different captas adding up a bunch of dice in order to get get it working it was a giant pain it took us several tries I began to wonder if I was actually part robot myself but the point is getting defensive about the problem didn't make the problem go away and the same is true about getting defensive about the lamb just because you tell people they have to be an expert to ask you questions won't stop the questions or the problems but now I want to take a quick detour into the source code of the rabbit itself because I also have reviewed parts of the source code and I have serious data privacy concerns there are things in this codebase and I can't share it for reasons that will become obvious there are things that malicious actors could use to get any access to the replies the R1 has ever given now of course rabbit might say they've dedicated a huge picture of a lock on their web page to privacy so you might think they're serious about it but this is the same company that if if you read the fine print they're tracking your precise geographic location and collect that data the only consolation prize is this thing is shockingly bad at tracking you which I found out while looking for restaurants find me a restaurant near here looking it up now Venetian Hot Plate sanan restaurant and Butter Churn are highly rated restaurants in Porter ranses for abroad I'm not in pantis let me see what I can find for restaurants near you in Austin Texas consider the following options I'm not in Austin an Italian restaurant in downtown I'm not in Austin Texas I use the internet connection to know where the R1 device is roughly located in order to provide you with you're off by about 100 miles [Music] thank you for the clarification let me refine the search for restaurants in your approximate location is it going to doing it is it going to do it it just stopped it just yeah I found its GPS to be really bad nevertheless I didn't want to take any chances for my next experiments which is why when I use this thing I'm not in the $10 million Studio at all I'm in an $100 Motel here to show you that once you know the code base you can make some surprising predictions about what this thing's going to do for example when I tell the rabbit to play anything You' might think that'd be random music going now but it's not going to be it's going to be the Beatles how did I know that stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop thank you uh the reason I know it's going to do that is because it's hardcoded to do so in their prompting they say if the user is going to say play anything they should play The Beatles even when you specify when I say play anything don't play play The Beatles got it understood play anything it's still okay starting the music player now another Beetle song uh I don't have the copyrights to that so we'll stop it right there all right back now in the $10 million studio for real no green screen back here look this product is obviously bad by the way it's off right right now but again what really upsets me is not that it's bad it's that the core selling point of this product is built on a lie and that lie is the Lamb they said it was on your device now it's a new foundational Ai and the reason this company had to sell you a $2 product was this AI was so powerful large action models concept and test results are so powerful now we decided to make a oneof kind mobile device yeah lamb what the justification for this hunk of plastic but where is it they say it's here now he said it was going to be controlling your apps but it's not it's hardcoded pre-written playwright scripts and look the best rabbit at this point can argue and it's hard to falsify or verify is that lamb might be part of the process of creating those automation hard-coded scripts for playright as in like no it's not live controlling your web browser or their web browser uh but it can create the code that does it maybe that's what they're going to argue but guess what playright already has a tool for this it's called code gen where it watches what you do and just automatically creates the automation code for you no fancy AI required so I think the best thing you could say at this point about Jesse and rabbit is that they vastly over promised and underd delivered the worst you could say is this is Consumer Fraud because even considering the possibility and it is one that lamb is a real research project that's not ready why lie about it being here now why not come clean and admit that whatever you're doing today is not what you originally advertised this is not a new foundational AI controlling websites like a human it's chat GPT with an auto clicker but there's one last thing I want to say I was able to speak with an employee who worked for rabbit and on the condition of anonymity what they told me was that lamb as advertised does not exist and that lamb was a quote marketing term now given that this was a very serious accusation I reached out one final time to the rabbit team to hear their response [Music] [Music]
